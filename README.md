# Eliza Chatbot

The original Eliza was one of the first chatbots created in the 1960s at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Eliza uses rogerian therapy to deconstruct the user's input to formulate a response. I created my own version of the Eliza using similar methods of deconstructing user input. However my Eliza strays away from acting as a professional therapist, and instead it is more of a casual pal to keep you company.
